An implicit alias is also the omission of the 'Get-' prefix for commands with this prefix. But when writing scripts that will potentially need to be maintained over time, either by the original author or another Windows PowerShell scripter, please consider using full cmdlet name instead of alias. Aliases can introduce these problems, readability, understandability and availability."

"AvoidUsingEmptyCatchBlock","PSAvoidUsingEmptyCatchBlock","Warning","Yes","No","Yes","Avoid Using Empty Catch Block","Empty catch blocks are considered poor design decisions because if an error occurs in the try block, this error is simply swallowed and not acted upon. While this does not inherently lead to bad things. It can and this should be avoided if possible. To fix a violation of this rule, using Write-Error or throw statements in catch blocks."
"AvoidUsingInvokeExpression","PSAvoidUsingInvokeExpression","Warning","Yes","No","Yes","Avoid Using Invoke-Expression","The Invoke-Expression cmdlet evaluates or runs a specified string as a command and returns the results of the expression or command. It can be extraordinarily powerful so it is not that you want to never use it but you need to be very careful about using it.  In particular, you are probably on safe ground if the data only comes from the program itself.  If you include any data provided from the user - you need to protect yourself from Code Injection. To fix a violation of this rule, please remove Invoke-Expression from script and find other options instead."
"AvoidUsingPlainTextForPassword","PSAvoidUsingPlainTextForPassword","Warning","Yes","No","Yes","Avoid Using Plain Text For Password Parameter","Password parameters that take in plaintext will expose passwords and compromise the security of your system."

"AvoidUsingWriteHost","PSAvoidUsingWriteHost","Warning","Yes","No","Yes","Avoid Using Write-Host","Avoid using the Write-Host cmdlet. Instead, use Write-Output, Write-Verbose, or Write-Information. Because Write-Host is host-specific, its implementation might vary unpredictably. Also, prior to PowerShell 5.0, Write-Host did not write to a stream, so users cannot suppress it, capture its value, or redirect it."
"DSCDscExamplesPresent","PSDSCDscExamplesPresent","Information","Yes","No","Yes","DSC examples are present","Every DSC resource module should contain folder ""Examples"" with sample configurations for every resource. Sample configurations should have resource name they are demonstrating in the title."

"MisleadingBacktick","PSMisleadingBacktick","Warning","Yes","No","Yes","Misleading Backtick","Ending a line with an escaped whitepsace character is misleading. A trailing backtick is usually used for line continuation. Users typically don't intend to end a line with escaped whitespace."

"PossibleIncorrectComparisonWithNull","PSPossibleIncorrectComparisonWithNull","Warning","Yes","No","Yes","Null Comparison","Checks that $null is on the left side of any equaltiy comparisons (eq, ne, ceq, cne, ieq, ine). When there is an array on the left side of a null equality comparison, PowerShell will check for a $null IN the array rather than if the array is null. If the two sides of the comaprision are switched this is fixed. Therefore, $null should always be on the left side of equality comparisons just in case."
"PossibleIncorrectUsageOfAssignmentOperator","PSPossibleIncorrectUsageOfAssignmentOperator","Warning","Yes","No","Yes","'=' is not an assignment operator. Did you mean the equality operator '-eq'?","'=' or '==' are not comparison operators in the PowerShell language and rarely needed inside conditional statements."
"PossibleIncorrectUsageOfRedirectionOperator","PSPossibleIncorrectUsageOfRedirectionOperator","Warning","Yes","No","Yes","'>' is not a comparison operator. Use  '-gt' (greater than) or '-ge' (greater or equal).","When switching between different languages it is easy to forget that '>' does not mean 'greater than' in PowerShell."

"UseSingularNouns","PSUseSingularNouns","Warning","Yes","Yes","Yes","Cmdlet Singular Noun","Cmdlet should use singular instead of plural nouns."
"UseSupportsShouldProcess","PSUseSupportsShouldProcess","Warning","Yes","No","Yes","Use SupportsShouldProcess","Commands typically provide Confirm and Whatif parameters to give more control on its execution in an interactive environment. In PowerShell, a command can use a SupportsShouldProcess attribute to provide this capability. Hence, manual addition of these parameters to a command is discouraged. If a commands need Confirm and Whatif parameters, then it should support ShouldProcess."
"UseToExportFieldsInManifest","PSUseToExportFieldsInManifest","Warning","Yes","No","Yes","Use the *ToExport module manifest fields.","In a module manifest, AliasesToExport, CmdletsToExport, FunctionsToExport and VariablesToExport fields should not use wildcards or $null in their entries. During module auto-discovery, if any of these entries are missing or $null or wildcard, PowerShell does some potentially expensive work to analyze the rest of the module."
"UseUsingScopeModifierInNewRunspaces","PSUseUsingScopeModifierInNewRunspaces","Warning","Yes","No","Yes","Use 'Using:' scope modifier in RunSpace ScriptBlocks","If a ScriptBlock is intended to be run as a new RunSpace, variables inside it should use 'Using:' scope modifier, or be initialized within the ScriptBlock."
